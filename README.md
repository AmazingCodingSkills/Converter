<p align="center">  
ðŸ’° Converter demonstrates modern Android development with Dagger, Coroutines, Flow, Jetpack (Room, ViewModel), and Material Design based on MVVM architecture.                                                     

## The app contains 3 base screens:   

- Main screen for display latest rates. It is possible to set up a base currency to calculate the exchange rate.  
By clicking on a specific currency, you can see more details.                                                
- Calculator screen to convert currency pairs.                                                     
- Settings screen with possibility share app.

## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 24
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
  - [Dagger](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/dagger-basics): for dependency injection.
- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model)
  - [Modularization](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization)
  - [Clean architecture](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture)
  - Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.

## Architecture


### Modularization

The application is divided according to the principle of multimodularity, within the modules, the division into packages according to the clean architecture.

### Architecture Overview

**Converter** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

## Result
Application completely in Kotlin. Support for changing device configuration has been implemented, the main logic is covered by unit tests, ui is covered by UI tests.
